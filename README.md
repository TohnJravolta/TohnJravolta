**Adaptive Systems Architect**  
⚗️ I synthesize ethical simulations and coordination tools so communities can test ideas and scale what works 🎯

## -☯️-

### Now building
- **[SuperSomethingGames.com](https://supersomethinggames.com)** — flagship games and simulations project
- **[AddressAlarm.com](https://AddressAlarm.com)** — open, on-device safety notes for drivers and travelers  
- **[Custom GPT Wizard](https://github.com/TohnJravolta/Custom_GPT_Wizard)** — practical guides and tools for Custom GPT workflows
- **[Entrogenics seeds](https://ask.report)** — patterns, models, and meta scale engines for coordination
- **[acid.quest](https://acid.quest)** — disolving reality into symbols and art-i-facts
- **IASIS.quest** — applied systems care: humane interfaces, rituals, and recovery patterns

### What I do
- Translate research into **reusable patterns** and **tiny protocols**  
- Prototype **ethical reality simulations** to explore options safely  
- Ship **docs, handoffs, and licenses** so work can outgrow me

### Featured projects
- **Super Burst** → adaptive retro arcade with “warp reality” dodge-and-climb flow

- **AddressAlarm** → AGPL, privacy-first Android app  
  Repo: https://github.com/TohnJravolta/AddressAlarm  
 
- **Custom_GPT_Wizard** → playbooks for building and improving Custom GPTs  
  Repo: https://github.com/TohnJravolta/Custom_GPT_Wizard  

- **Entrogenics** → notes, models, and experiments behind the framework  
  Repo: https://github.com/TohnJravolta/Entrogenics  

### Principles
- **Commons first** — open licenses, clear credit, simple rules  
- **Small engines** — minimal tools that chain together  
- **Visible handoffs** — docs, checklists, and maintainer paths
