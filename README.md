# Tohn · he/him

**Complex Systems Architect**  
I build ethical simulations and simple coordination tools so communities can test ideas and scale what works.

---

### Now building
- **AddressAlarm** — open, on-device safety notes for drivers and travelers.  
- **Custom GPT Wizard** — practical guides and tools for Custom GPT workflows.  
- **Entrogenics seeds** — patterns, models, and small engines for coordination.  
- **Turtle Base** — playful “portal” collages and simulation motifs for ASK.

### What I do
- Translate research into **reusable patterns** and **tiny protocols**  
- Prototype **ethical reality simulations** to explore options safely  
- Ship **docs, handoffs, and licenses** so work can outgrow me

### Featured projects

### Principles
- **Commons first** — open licenses, clear credit, simple rules  
- **Small engines** — minimal tools that chain together  
- **Visible handoffs** — docs, checklists, and maintainer paths
